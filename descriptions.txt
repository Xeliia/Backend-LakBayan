    geoapify

the goal of the app is to provide an app to the people about terminals and stuff
if they start the webapp a button will appear saying start which will scan their gps location and show the nearest terminals in a 10km radius relative to their positions and the points will appear in the map in that 10 km radius

each point is a terminal (it can be bus, jeep, tricycles, van and trains)
when a point is clicked it will show what type of vehicle that terminal is
think of it like a dictionary whereit can show their end locations and the corresponding price
community driven for user submission
route is hardcoded (sets of coordinates to construct a polyline)

current databse:

User
- Django na bahala
- gagamit ng Django allauth 

Region
- id
- name

City
- id
- name
- region_id (FK → Region Table)

Terminal
- id
- name (Actually Kahit ano to?, sinali lang for like if may pangalan ung terminal. ex jac liner, )
- description (kung mag uupload ng burat si user)
- latitude
- longtitude
- city_id (FK → City)
- verified (boolean, default false) (kung legit actual terminal)
- added_by (FK → User)
- (ratings, addition based nalang to, like if may nag downvote minus 1 pwede mag niggative)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)

ModeOfTransport
- id
- mode_name  -- ung sinabi ni anthoncakes
- fare_type ENUM('fixed', 'distance_based')  (actually kaya meron neto para sa mga cases kung incremental ung fare based on km or like fixed kahit intermediate stop binabaan

Route
- id
- terminal_id (FK → Terminal)  -- origin terminal
- destination (or the last coordinate in the routestop table)
- mode_id (FK → ModeOfTransport)
- verified (boolean, default false)
- added_by (FK → User, optional)
- description (optional) (kung anong route to)
- polyline (coords)

RouteStop
- id
- route_id (FK → Route)
- sequence
- stop_name (text)  (stop description can be terminal or just a location basta kung san baba)
- terminal_id (FK → Terminal, optional) (kung endpoint terminal)
- fare (decimal)
- distance
- time
- latitude
- longtitude

things to note

when doing the routing.

1. Network as a graph
- Each terminal (tricycle, bus, LRT, etc.) is a node.
- Each hardcoded route (with its polyline and details) is an edge connecting two terminals.
2. routing algorithm
- When a user requests a route from their location to a destination:
- Find nearest terminal to the user’s location (e.g., tricycle terminal).
- Find nearest terminal to the destination (e.g., LRT station or TUP).
- Use a graph algorithm (like Dijkstra’s) to find the best path through your network of terminals and routes.
- The algorithm will select the sequence: tricycle → bus → LRT → walk.
- Each leg uses your hardcoded polyline and details.
- For first/last legs (if not at a terminal), use walking/driving directions (Geoapify or similar).

flow
User location → Tricycle terminal (walk, geoapify)
Tricycle terminal → Binan bus terminal (tricycle, polyline)
Binan bus terminal → LRT station (bus, polyline)
LRT station → TUP (LRT, polyline)
LRT station → TUP (walk, Geoapify)
